Had been there for lunch and this place on a Sunday afternoon was almost empty. Food was just okay, I feel most of it was stale.  Well Chinese food is supposed to be cooked fresh with a burst of flavours and served hot.

One, water was dripping from the ceiling right behind our table. Two, the layout is such that people can walk across the restaurant to go from inside of the mall to the outside (or vice versa). Is it a restaurant within a mall or the other way around?  Service - 2 stars. 1. A waiter walks up to us and tells us, \" I'll be waiting for you tonight\" . Great! A personalized dining experience...is what we thought we'd get. But we didn't. The waiter was all around the place waiting for several other tables just like any other budget restaurant. ( This isn't a budget restaurant by any means though). Had to try desperately to get his attention a few times. We had at least 2 other waiters come by our table to take orders. Even the Manager ( it looked like him) came by our table. They look confused. Unorganized.  2. Besides the quality and quantity of food, what really puts any diner off is the restaurant telling them that the food they want is unavailable. What makes it even worse is them telling this to us several minutes after taking the order! This is exactly what happened with us. After going through their exhaustive list of menu, we decided to order a particular style of salad. The waiter takes the order. We are looking forward to tasting something new. Several minutes later, the waiter returns and tells us that the main ingredient itself of the salad isn't available. What a shame! If it's not available, mention it in your menu! Or at least make your waiters aware!  Food - 2 stars. Ordered a style of fried fish for starters. It was covered with tons of flour and was excessively oily. Not good at all. The noodles that we ordered tasted good. I must give this to them. But again, it was way too oily. Had two different styles of dimsums which tasted just fine. But the quantity was meagre, to put it politely. Which brings me to the final segment...  Price - 2 stars. Now it doesn't matter if I'm super rich or super poor. I've come to your restaurant to get your services for which I'm paying. And I want the worth of every penny I'm spending, back. Just four pcs of dimsums for well over 400 rupees? A 100 bucks for just 1 dimsum? Are you joking? It is not even a Michelin rated restaurant nor is the service upto the mark. Totally unfair and unjust pricing.  Also, we ordered a ginger ale from their bar menu. Was expecting something original coming off their bar which was right next to our table. But what we got was a glass full of ice and a can of Schweppes Ginger Ale! Are you absolutely kidding us??  Won't be coming back here nor going to recommend anybody unless at least a couple of the above mentioned concerns are dealt with.","id":43500029,"rating_color":"FF7800","review_time_friendly":"7 days
