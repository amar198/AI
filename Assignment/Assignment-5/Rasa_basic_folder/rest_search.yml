Their cocktails are really unique and well made and I totally recommend you to try these unique concoctions. In appetizers, I tried the salmon sushi, chicken dumplings, salmon nigiri, pork belly and pink pepper Prawns and they did not fail to impress. The presentation of the food and drinks was stellar too. In main course I tried a bunch noodles and rice dishes and they were all delicious. The snickers cake is the perfect way to end a meal here. Totally recommend this place for lovers of Asian food",

Also present, are Chopsticks on every table ;)  Must try their locally flavoured Long Island Ice Tea.  Extensive variety with Dumplings as well.  Courteous Staff. Excellent Decor.  Even if you are vegetarian, you get plenty of options to choose from (which is some kind of a rare commodity these days in Authentic Chinese Places)  This placs might be heavier on your pocket, but the experience is worth every penny.",

I recently visited Asia Kitchen and it was the first time in asia kitchen. I found the food quality and taste here to be pretty much the same.  I visited Asia Kitchen for a tasting of their Clay Pot festival which is on till end of June 2019.   I love the chicken with chili it was perfect and It was giving me a fragrance of clay which made this dish more delicious. The Malaysian Fish Curry in clay pot too was unequally amazing if not better! The flavours were a lot like thai curry. Even the vegetarian clay pots were great.  This was my first time with complete authentic Chinese food, and it was amazing. The food is sumptuous, that you will be amazed. The sushi and dim sums were garnished beautifully and tasted good.   Mango Pudding and other was small dumplings in shape of laddu with coconut filling inside. Both of these items were 5/5.   Not to miss, their range of cocktails was astonishing.  Their staff is so polite, attentive and alert.  Food- 5/5  Service- 4.5/5  Ambience- 4/5",

The ambience is pretty great with Oriental carvings all along and great service on board.  Here's what you gotta try if you go in!!  The food on showcase were the Clay pot dishes , so I'll start here-  Sanpei Chicken - the best of the lot, bite sized chicken pieces in a dark brown gravy.  Shredded Duck with Mango- Again an interesting combination to try , the mango goes in very well with the duck.  I also tried Malaysian Fish Curry in a clay pot along with other vegetarian clay pots , and they were pretty good too.  Starters were the show stealers tho-  We were served two types of sushi!! The Blue Rice sushi was a feast for the eyes while the Cream Cheese Avacado sushi was the one to Tantalize the mouth. I downed two plates of these.  The Chicken Pakchoy wrap in Sichuan Sauce was some heavenly stuff. This was an individual chicken ball in a wrap and dipping sauce.  Coming down to the dessert,  There were these coconut dumplings with date syrup, which practically tasted like a steamed modak.  Also, there was mango pudding which was some good stuff, can't go wrong with that.  The festival is on till the end of June if you wanna try this out !!",

                "review_text": "Level 5 Bistro and Bar is a little tour around the globe itself in terms of food and ambiance. After the success stories of Kalinga, A European bistro brings the global cuisine to your tables to give you an experience of food around the globe. It's not just a literal representation of global experience in terms of food but also in terms of ambiance.  This cute little bistro stands at Vakil Nagar, Erandwane on top of the same building as Kalinga at guess what Level 5. The place has a whole different vibe going on right after you reach the floor, from the Posters of almost every city around the globe hanging on the wall to the a sweet dessert corner along with a pizza oven, even their bar has a feel good vibe. Offering a Valet Parking to able to house upto 60 cars, the place has spared a thought for their customers in  every possible ways. After a lot of my friends going gaga about the place for a while and reading a several blogs that talks nothing but highly of the place, I've been thinking to go there for a while until I got invited for a blogger's table. And Here a list of some of the amazing dishes that I got to try my hands on:-  SHAKES:-  Chocolate, Caramel & Popcorn Shake (225 INR):- I've never been impressed as much by a shake ever before. I happened to read about this drink so much on the social media that I happened to have a presumption it being awesome, and It actually was. The flavours of Chocolate with caramel blends so well with the crunch of Popcorn that I must say - They've got the chill, you bring you Netflix lol.  Chocolate, Cookie & Walnut Shake (225 INR):- Just like the Chocolate, Caramel & Popcorn Shake, This one is also in every possible ways - a perfect blend of Chocolate, Cookie and Walnut. The flavours are so natural and fresh that you can't stop sipping I bet.  FLAVOURED YOGHURT SMOOTHIES:-  Mango & Coconut (200 INR):- Okay first things first, I don't like Yoghurt and I don't like Yoghurt Smoothies but why will that matter right? I'm sure the drinks here has some magical essence to it, because I loved the drink to the last sip of it. And, thee flavours of Mango & Coconut just adds to the  beauty of the whole experience.  BREADS AND MORE:-  Prawn Toast:- Starting from the fact that they bake their own breads, It is also a fact that I don't like Toasts, but I love Prawns (More than anyting). And Just like the Mango & Yoghurt Smoothie, this place has really made me think about my thoughts on breads(toast) all over again for the sesame crusted and fried minced Prawns on Garlic Loaf.  Level 5 Club Sandwich (350 INR):- And, Here comes bread again and to this point, I really don't think what I liked and what I didn't did even matter at all. Every single dish here was cooked to such a perfection that this one could only turn out be a wow and nothing else. A platter filled with Jumbo Bread Slices Layered with Lettuce, Vegetables, Cheese & Creamy Chicken Salad with fried eggs came with a portion of french fries, onion and salad and did turn out to be a wow(as expected).  SMALL BITES:-  Curry Peels & Dips (200 INR):- The curried potato skin cooked till crisp and served with their Signature Sour Yoghurt Dip, Smoked Bourbon Hickery Ketchup & Mustard Dip is surely as claimed to be the most wanted bar bite and I don't have any doubts in that. But Wait a sec and read this - \"You need to fight for their Bourbon Hickery Ketchup if you're sharing your peels with anyone else, and trust me it's worth it\".  Achari Paneer (Irani Chelo Kebabs) (250 INR):- They have done every justice to the Black Rice Cooked in Milk which is topped with Big Chunks of Paneer Kebabs which is served with Grilled Tomatoes and Roast Onion.  4 Hour Pork Ribs (425 INR):- I don't even known what to say about this. I'm still awestruck and hanging the memories of every bite that I took of this. Weird right? Well Nah! It's worth every madness. Just for the record, this is the best from the lot we are talking about. Just like the Popcorn Shake I've read so much about their Pork Ribs on Social Media and one line of some review just got stuck with me - \"The Ribs are so soft that the bones just slide out on their own\". And I must also mention that this was my first time ever trying Pork Ribs and I just wanted it to be a good experince, also after reading so much about it I already had a certain level of expectations from this one and then I took a bite and it just melted in mouth and My mind was like - \"What The..... Woooooooooow!!!!\"  ROOMALI QUESADILLA:-  Bhuna Kathal (250 INR):- I take immense pride in saying that I was the only person the other day on the table to identify the special ingredient of the Quesadilla lol haha. Jokes Apart, Right after I took the first, It just reminded me of my home and my mother. Coming from North, It was very overwhelming for me to relate with something so easily under that heavy pile of so many global cuisines, And I tell you what I'm surely going back for this one!!  PAN SEARED DIMSUM:-  Caramalised Pulled Chicken Dimsum (285 INR):- I don't even wanna give feedbacks anymore, This was unbelievable, Level 5 seems to be game with every single preparation. I mean even the Dimsums? These Chicken dumplings are cooked twice , steamed and then grilled crisp to a perfection.  KERALA PEPPER FRY:-  Kerala Pepper Fry Chicken (285 INR):- As the name suggests, The Chicken is tossed with Black Pepper, Chilies, Coriander & Coconut leaving strong yet subtle flavour of every single ingredient.  DESSERTS:-  Chocolate Bomb (250 INR):- This Chocolate dessert make it irresistible to see a plate full of molten chocolate bomb preparation along with a portion of berry compote which makes it sweet but tangy along with Vanilla Ice-Cream to make this whole dessert more dreamy. The trick is to mix everything together for a surprising bite.  Level 5 Tiramisu (250 INR):- Do you believe in love at first sight? 'Cause This just got my eyes rolling, This just didn't looked gorge but tasted super yumm too. This coffee-flavoured Italian has never disappointed me but this one at Level 5 got me doing a whole photo-shoot flaunting myself and telling everyone that there could be no better way to end a super delicious meal than this super delicious dessert.  I can surely I had such an amazing lunching experience here at Level 5 that I am literally head over heels in love with every single dish that I had here. And You know what you can head to this beautiful place and experience the same with a 30% discount on Food from 11am to 7pm - Monday to Thursday. Have a great one!!  Thank You VMAD Media for extending the invite and Thank You Team Level 5 for hosting us.",

The entrance to level 5 itself is appealing with beautiful lighting and colorful flooring. The interior is well done with lots of browns - wooden furnishings,brick walls,large wooden windows, pillars, ceiling etc. which looks extremely prepossessing. Even the staff is well dressed adding to the overall look and feel of the place. As soon as you enter there is a dessert section and the pizza area. There is also a bar at the fag end. Now coming to the food, the menu is well crafted with lots of interesting and fresh options. We ordered a mushroom soup, veg pizza and calcutta bhetki with some mocktails. The presentation is very attractive. The texture and taste of calcutta bhetki was unbeatable,pizza was delicious,soup was smooth and the mocktail was fresh.To end it all I was served a mango dessert (for my birthday) which was a pure melt in the mouth!Such a good gesture from the staff- thank you!",

In food we ordered:  Veg red Thai curry: one of the best, and it was perfect in consistency and taste  Dark chocolate milk shake: Too good  Quinoa penne in light cream sauce: The best, hands down. Creamy and awesome  Mango milkshake: the only disappointing thing. The mangoes were not very sweet, hence the milkshake had a tangy taste.",

Sante Spa cuisine was highly recommended to us for its unique vegan cuisine by a friend who had visited Pune. Hence, it was always on our must-visit list whenever we would visit Pune. The first time we dropped in here was on a late evening, when we were running late for a movie and asked them to surprise us with a few dishes which would be nice and quickly served (as we didn't really have the time to browse through the menu!). And boy, they sure did surprise us. So much so that we were back for lunch the very next day, to do justice to the food by having an elaborate complete meal.  It's been a while now but there are a few dishes that I distinctly remember loving:  1. Black Wasabi Ice cream - I don't remember the last time activated charcoal and Wasabi tasted so amazing.  2. Beetroot hummus - Healthy hummus with the goodness and redness of beetroots!  3. Zucchini kebabs - We all love our tikkis and when it contains stuff like zucchini, I love it more!  4. Pure coconut and Palm jaggery ice cream - This one is for those who love the desi coconut - jaggery combination. Well, I'm not really a fan of this combo but it was liked by everyone who did, including me.  5. Rice - now I'm not really sure about this, but we did order 2 varieties of rice during our two meals there (maybe Thai curry and rice once and Pilaf on the other occasion). Don't remember being disappointed.  Sante Spa Cuisine is located at Koregaon Park just next to the Osho Ashram and the guests visiting here are of all varieties, of course all having a taste for such kind of cuisine! There's a branch of this restaurant in Mumbai as well but I'm told that it isn't close to the original one at Pune. Do visit here atleast once for an amazing vegan experience!",

Would visit this place again of possible.  The google maps location is wrong. Please get it corrected.",

Having been in Pune for more than 3yrs now I strongly agree that this was my BEST EVER dinner experience in Pune. We ordered a delectable pasta, flourishing Hummus platter, mouth watering pizza and the yummy lasagne. We truly did love every bite of each of the dishes that we had. Kudos to the management for making the glittery ambience so peaceful yet relishable. And since it is located in Koregaon Park, you'll see a cosmo-crowd and many pretty foreigners seated near you. I'll recommend this must-go place to everyone in the country(if you happen to visit Pune) to treat yourself with the perfect combination of sumptuous veg and healthy food.👌😋",

They have a good collection of toppings which are served generously over each piece of waffle. My top 3 favourites are Dark Belgian chocolate mousse, Banana Nutella, Banana Cinnamon. This place is my absolute favourite and everyone that I bring here or recommend to, have simply loved it!!! Keep it up guys...",

                "review_text": "Oh My God !!!!!! This place is simply AWESOME !!!!  This was suggested by my friend since a long time, so I had this on top of my mind whenever we would visit next for sweethtooth cravings.  Since my husband loves desserts ( basically anything sweet), I decided to hop on to this place on a Friday evening.  Ambience is very simple. There are a lot of options in waffles which will confuse you in selecting as they all sound so tempting ! There is no seating arrangement but they do have a counter top to keep your plates while you satisfy your sweet craving.  Now coming to the TASTE - We ordered Belgium chocolate with Nutella and white chocolate waffles. Hands down both were the best I ever had. Waffles are so fresh and crunchy that the smell was still oozing out of it like it's fresh from the oven/waffle maker! I would say the quantity could have been little more, but I believe I just never wanted it to finish 😁  Definitely coming back for more!!

I went her one evening during monsoon and it could not have been better!  I tried the following - 1. Hot chocolate - They have eight varieties of hot chocolate from the mildest milk chocolate to the darkest dark chocolate! I went for a milk chocolate one and it was amazing! I have not had this good a hot chocolate in a long time! They also served us marshmallows on the house with the hot chocolate!  2. Chicken pepperoni pretzel - They have mini pretzels with a filling of pepperoni and cheese and it's great for a snack if you do not want to eat too much!  3. Farmers sandwich - This had veggies and cheese and had an accompaniment of fries! It was delicious and filling at the same time!  I will definitely go back here, especially for the hot chocolate ❣️  Follow me on Instagram for regular updates around town - @sadhnaadvani1604",

It is very risky to mess with a dish so deep rooted in tradition but their modern blend only makes the experience better. There is not one variety that doesn't taste good and I love them even more for their green thumb initiative. I have unfortunately moved to Bombay but I visit them almost every time I cross their store/stall in Pune. BIG LOVE TO THE SIBLINGS & THE MOM!",

The best one is their dry fruit kheer and gulkand kheer.  Other too are nice one. But above too are my favourite.   They have started with Mango kheer which is ok.  The prices are ok not too low. There is suggestion if you could increase the size of the packaging. Start with some like 5 or 10. If you get a good response you can go with it.",

The food pairings were rather interesting, on point and very flavourful. Without doubt, Chef Mohan and Mahika are huge assets for you and they most certainly made our time at Zeta very warm and fun. KK ensured we were waltzed in to our special table without any fuss and was rather warm in his dealings. My compliments to you on the team you have built up.  Certainly missed you there but am hoping we can correct that in the near future.  None of this would have been possible without your efforts and warm touch. A huge thank you from our family Have a super vacation ! Warm regards, Neeraj",

We chose to stay outdoor.  I just want to say that, in addition to a nice meal, we had a delightful person serving us, Mahika. She had just the right balance of friendliness and efficiency. She and other staff members made certain that we had everything we needed. Kudos!  The food was fresh, properly prepared and a great value for the price. We highly recommend it. You must try Mango Prawn Tacos (see the picture)  They also had wine available at retail price, good selection of Indian and international wines.  Once again THANK YOU SO MUCH for everything! We had a great time.",

However, we were left disappointed at the end of my meal (to say the least). The food quality was not up to the mark and we were particularly let down by the bland prawns and salty soup. Service was poor. Some of the staff were even downright rude. I don't think I will ever visit again.",

No too complicated.  Service is laid back and informal. They need to improve upon this. Also if they can shift to Hand menus instead of black board ones.  Booking is recommended.",

We ordered Chicken harissa, Aglio Olio pasta and chicken n Iceberg salad. Of all the things Salad was the best and Harissa chicken was also quite good. Pasta was a bit watery to my surprise but tasted good as well.  We did try the ice teas and lemonade, which were well made.  A must try is espresso panna cotta. If you are a desert lover, you will fall in love for this sweet delight.  Will come again to try other stuff they serve.  You must try as well.",

Great soup followed by tasty starters ( salt and pepper tempura, dimsums and corn /potato). Main course had noodles, stir fried veggies in dark sauce and rice. The dessert had a choice of brownie with icecream and mango pudding).  Nice peaceful ambience, helpful staff and good service. I'd recommend this to everyone for their variety of Asian cuisine!",

Tell you what, after all the roaming around, it was absolutely worth it! Only serving crêpes (Veg, NonVeg and dessert), and I liked that straightforward approach of menu. You take one look, and you know what you wanna have. Crepes are like European version of Pancakes, or like the outlet puts it, a counterpart of Dosa. Had a chicken and a chocolate Crepe, both were absolutely scrumptious! Liked the ambiance around the food truck, a suggestion is that they could set up tables and chairs in a much fancier way to make it even more compelling! Loved the fact that a female entrepreneur, with a novel idea, is employing female workers, delightful! They could certainly extend the menu, by adding more filling ideas! Overall, a highly recommended place!",

The food i felt was highly overrated. Far more better deserts options can be found in the city.",
